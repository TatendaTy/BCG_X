**GitHub Description:**

This repository encompasses a comprehensive case study on leveraging data science to combat customer churn in the utility industry, with a primary focus on a gas and electricity utility company facing high churn rates among SMEs. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the development of a predictive model to identify and address potential churn-prone customers.

**Key Features:**

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth exploration of client and price datasets, revealing patterns, insights, and key variables influencing customer churn.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new features, including those related to price sensitivity, contract duration, and recent contract updates, enhancing the predictive power of the model.

- **Model Development:** Training and evaluating various models, with a detailed focus on the Random Forest Classifier as the top performer based on accuracy metrics.

- **Data Sampling and Imbalance Handling:** Employing techniques such as SMOTE to address imbalanced classes and ensure robust model training and evaluation.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimization of model performance through hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV, with a focus on enhancing recall for positive samples.

- **Insights into Churn Drivers:** Analysis of feature importance, revealing influential factors such as net margin, consumption patterns, and time-related features.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and provide feedback as we work towards refining the model and gaining deeper insights into customer churn dynamics in the utility industry.
